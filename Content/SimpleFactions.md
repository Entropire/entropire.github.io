## Description
SimpleFactions is a team managment system of in minecraft .
I started this project around 2022 with limited programming knowledge. 
At the time, I experimented freely without using GitHub or project management tools — I just “figured it out as I went.”

Around 2023–2024, after starting my education in game development, I restarted the project. 
I began using GitHub to track the codebase and rewrote the project from scratch, 
applying what I had learned about structuring code and version control.

now in 2025, I am taking it further by rewriting the project again, this time with a focus on: 

- Dynamic functionality — making the system flexible and reusable in multiple environments
- Project management — using Kanban for organization
- Professional practices — modular design, clean architecture, and Git-based workflow

This evolution reflects my growth from a beginner experimenting with code to a more confident developer applying best practices, version control, and scalable design.

The goal of this project is to create a team system where players can:
- Create, delete, and modify teams
- Invite and kick other players
- Communicate securely through a private chat

At the same time, I wanted the system to be modular and extensible, so I could easily expand the codebase without touching the core functionality of the project.

## Core Features
- Create, delete, and modify teams
- Invite and kick other players
- Communicate securely through private chat 
- Modular design that allows easy expansion without touching core functionality

## Outcome
