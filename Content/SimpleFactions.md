## Description
I started this project because I wanted a system in Minecraft that could do more than the default system in Minecraft. I began with limited programming knowledge, but that didn’t stop me. After four years of on-and-off programming, multiple rewrites, and significant improvements in code quality, I created version 2.1. It has been installed 890 times, with all versions combined totaling 1,791 installations.

The main goals of this project were for players to be able to: 
- Create teams with a name and color
- Invite and join teams
- Manage their team more easily using a user-friendly UI
- Chat securaly in a faction only chat

## Core features
- Lightweight and plug-and-play
- Create, join, invite, and manage factions easily
- Faction-only and public chat modes
- UI-based interface for ease of use
- Zero configuration needed (defaults included)
- User-friendly UI intervace
