# SimpleFactions
Custom Minecraft plugin enabling players to form factions, invite friends, and communicate securely

## Description
I started this project because I wanted a simple and easy to use way to create factions on my minecraft server.
This plugin allows users to easily create, delete, and modify factions, as well as invite or remove players.
This plugin is available for free on modrinth and many people liked the plugin because it was simple and not bloated with features.

## Features
- Factions are saved to a local database
- Create, delete and modify factions
- Join, invite or remove players from your faction
- Minecraft GUI and Minecraft chat command-line interface
