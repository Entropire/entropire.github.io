## Description
I created this project because I found myself rewriting a command interface in multiple c# projects.
So to stop myself from reinventing the wheel and to save time, I decided to build a reusable command system that I could use in all my project where I needed it.
The goal of this project was to create a lightweight, easy-to-use library that provides a flexible way to define, register and trigger commands.
And publish it as a NuGet package for convenient reuse that u can install here//insert link.

## Core Features
- Define commands with ease
- Register and deregister commands dynamically
- Switch between command handlers effortlessly
- Trigger commands based on user input

## Outcome
The end result of the project is a library that allows you to define, register, deregister and class commands on rune time.

## Command Definition
You can create and register a command dynamically either using a class or a lambda expression.

For example, you can create a command with a dedicated class:
```cs
[CommandName("eco")]
public class EcoCommand : Command { ... }

_handler.RegisterCommand(EcoCommand);
```

Or define one inline using a lambda:
```cs
_handler.RegisterCommand("Hello", (args, name) => Console.WriteLine("Hello"));
```

## Command Storage
Commands are stored in a dictionary for fast lookup and to ensure that no two commands share the same name
```cs
private Dictionary<string, Action<string, string[]>> dictionaryOfCommands = new(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

## Command Calling
Commands can be executed simply by passing a user input string to the handler:
```cs
string userInput = "/eco helloworld"
_handler.Execute(userInput);
``` 
In the background the input string is automatically split into the command name and its arguments,
and the command corresponding to the command name is executed. 

For example, the input ```"/eco helloworld"``` would be parsed into:
- Command Name: ```"eco"```
- Arguments: ```"["helloworld"]"``` 

This makes it easy to handle user input without manually parsing string every time and ensures that the user inputs is always parsed in the same way.

## Reflection
Working on SimpleCommands helped me think carefully about modular and reusable library design.
I learned how to create a flexible API that supports both class-based and inline commands, and how to handle user input consistently with minimal boilerplate.
I also learned how to publish a C# library on NuGet, making it easier to share and reuse across different projects.

If I were to continue developing this library, Iâ€™d like to add async command support, 
improve error handling and logging, 
and explore ways to extend the command parser for more complex input patterns.
